# slicer-skill

This repository provides the groundwork for an **AI coding skill** that assists with
programming questions related to [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org).  The primary piece of
content is `SKILLS.md` which describes how an agent can prepare its environment and what
resources are available for search.

## Getting started

1. Read `SKILLS.md` for detailed information about the expected workflow and data
   sources.
2. Run the helper script to fetch the required repositories:
   ```sh
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
3. Use the resulting local copies when answering questions by searching for
   code, files, and community discussions across the cloned repositories.
